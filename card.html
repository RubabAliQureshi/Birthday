    <div class="overflow-y-auto max-h-[70vh] leading-relaxed space-y-4 text-justify px-2">
      <p>Can't believe it's already been 2 years since I got to know you. Throughout all this time you haven't just been a good roommate but a close friend too and when I say close friend, I actually mean it by heart.</p>

      <p>We've eaten together, lived together, cried and laughed and celebrated together (except study). Itni sari cheezen I am remembering right now from the very first day we met — never thought we would come this far from that moment.</p>

      <p>From being formal and asking “Agar apne parhna hai to you can turn on the light” to “Maine sona hai light off kardena uth k.” From “Agar apne nahana hai to ap jao main baad main naha lungi” to “Maine bhi nahana hai, garam pani kam use karna.” From “What did you eat today?” to “Let’s go eat.”</p>

      <p>We've come a long way and every event holds beautiful memories worth cherishing for a lifetime. You might not have even realized it, but sometimes amidst the rough days, your presence on the bed in front of me could be very calming and reassuring.</p>

      <p>Room main aakey poorey din ka dump and cyber tea spilling despite being tired or whatever — keeping you caught up with all the chaos of GIKI, sharing secrets, asking for advice, and so much more. If I start listing, it’ll become a whole essay.</p>

      <p>You've been an amazing companion all along, without a doubt. You're kind, caring, brave, more intelligent than you think Miss DHL & Captain, and so beautiful — one of the most amazing and remarkable people I've ever met.</p>

      <p>I know this journey hasn’t always been very pleasant or full of laughter — sometimes it was sad or low. We've had ups and downs too, but it never got in the way of how much I cared about you or loved you as a friend, very close to my heart.</p>

      <p>Humans are supposed to make mistakes or get caught in messes, even unintentionally. Such phases are part of good friendships. But what makes the difference is letting the past go and keeping the hearts clean and close.</p>

      <p>From staying in MC with you, to the library, to Corner Store, to our room — we might not be in the same room anymore, but my room will always be yours, like your own. And I’ll always be the same person as before — always here for you in anything.</p>

      <p>Whatever the circumstances, nothing will ever change the affection I have for my dear friend who made GIKI home for me. You're an amazing person, and I couldn’t have asked for a better roommate. I’ll always be grateful for the 2 amazing years I got to share with Atainable Waseem.</p>

      <p>Genuinely very happy and proud of you on all of your achievements and I pray from the bottom of my heart that you get everything you wish for — because you deserve the best, you deserve it all.</p>

      <p>I’ll keep talking if I keep this any longer, but our friendship isn't something I can describe fully in a few words. Just want you to know — you matter a lot to me and will always stay close to my heart.</p>

      <p>Can't wait to meet you in person — it's been so long. Wish you all the best for everything in life and all the happiness of the world.</p>
